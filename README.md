# First-Java-Project-ranim
My very first Java project focused on procedural logic and student data management.
# Student Grade Statistics System 🎓

## 📝 Description
This was my **ever first programming project**. It was developed using **Java Fundamentals** to demonstrate my early understanding of programming logic. At the time of development, I focused on **Procedural Programming** (before I was introduced to Object-Oriented Programming/OOP).

The system serves as a basic administrative tool for schools to manage student data, calculate grades, and extract academic statistics.

## 🚀 Features
* **Admin Authentication:** Simple login system with username and password.
* **Student Management (CRUD):** * Add new student records (Name, ID, Grade, Address).
    * Display all registered students.
    * Modify existing student grades based on ID.
    * Delete student records.
* **Academic Analytics:**
    * Automatically identifies the **Highest** and **Lowest** grades in the system.
    * **Grade Classification:** Categorizes students into (A, B, C, D, F) based on their scores.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation (Java Fundamentals)
As this was my foundational project, it relies on core Java concepts:
* [cite_start]**Parallel Arrays:** Used to store and link student data (Name, ID, Address, and Grade) across multiple arrays [cite: 10-13].
* **Static Methods:** Logic is modularized into dedicated methods for better readability and structure.
* [cite_start]**Scanner Class:** Extensively used for handling user inputs and managing the input buffer  [cite: 17, 34, 61-68].
* [cite_start]**Control Flow:** Implementation of `switch-case` and `if-else` ladders for menu navigation and grading logic  [cite: 27, 51, 127-133].

## 🧠 What I Learned
* Handling the Java `Scanner` buffer issues (switching between `nextInt()` and `nextLine()`).
* [cite_start]Managing fixed-size data structures (Arrays with a limit of 100 entries) [cite: 10-13].
* Building complex logical flows using procedural code.

## 📌 Note
This project represents my starting point in Computer Science. It laid the groundwork for my transition into more advanced topics like **OOP**, **Data Structures**, and **C programming**.
