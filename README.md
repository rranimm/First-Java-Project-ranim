# First-Java-Project-ranim

My very first Java project focused on procedural logic and student data management.

## Student Grade Statistics System 🎓

## 📝 Description
This was my **very first programming project**. It was developed using Java fundamentals to demonstrate my early understanding of programming logic. At the time of development, I focused on procedural programming (before I learned object-oriented programming).

The system is a basic administrative tool for schools to manage student data, calculate grades, and extract academic statistics.

## 🚀 Features
- **Admin Authentication:** Simple username/password login.
- **Student Management (CRUD):**
  - Add new student records (Name, ID, Grade, Address).
  - Display all registered students.
  - Modify existing student grades by ID.
  - Delete student records.
- **Academic Analytics:**
  - Identifies the highest and lowest grades.
  - Grade classification into A, B, C, D, F based on scores.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation (Java fundamentals)
- Parallel arrays are used to store student fields (name, ID, address, grade).
- Static methods are used to modularize logic.
- Scanner is used for user input; the code handles buffer issues between nextInt() and nextLine().
- Control flow is implemented with switch/case and if/else statements.

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Handling Java Scanner buffer issues (switching between nextInt() and nextLine()).
- Managing fixed-size data structures (arrays limited to 100 entries).
- Building program logic using a procedural style.

## ✅ Getting started
1. Compile: javac Main.java
2. Run: java Main

Adjust filenames/commands if your project uses different file names or a package structure.
